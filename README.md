# Getting Started with Create React App

Recruitement project.
Choose player name and color.
You can move the character by pressing arrow on your keyboard.

## Reccomendation

I reccomend to use Chrome as a browser to use the app because the native color picker in that browser seems to be the best one - cleanest and simpliest to use

## Available Scripts

### `install scripts`

Run `yarn install` from the command line before running the project for the first time


### `npm start`

Run developement enviroment on localhost:3000, auto-reload

### `npm test`

Run tests

### `npm run build`

Build the app
